I am a FEM expert, with a PhD in this area, and I am teaching PERMAS to my University students. It is a pity that a lot of other software packages (some of them of lower level) are included in the English Wikipedia while PERMAS is not. This package is ideal for students training and also operates in the biggest manufacturing industries such as Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, aerospace engineering industries, etc.\nThank you.
